Queue Storage in azure asp.net core 

In an Order Processing System, orders are placed via an ASP.NET Core API, then added to an Azure queue. A background worker processes orders from the queue asynchronously and stores related files in Azure Blob Storage.
ðŸ”‘ Key Benefits:
Asynchronous Processing: Orders are processed in the background without blocking the main API.
Scalability: Offload tasks to background workers to handle higher traffic.
Decoupling: Separate order submission and processing for cleaner architecture.
ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters:
Using Azure Queue Storage with ASP.NET Core ensures your app stays responsive, scalable, and maintainable while handling background tasks seamlessly.
